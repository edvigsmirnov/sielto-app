/// The figures for one income cycle (spec 4.7).
///
/// The mechanism is the same chronological walk every mode uses. What differs
/// is only where it starts and what it may see: it starts from the anchor
/// income, which lands on the first day of the period by construction, and it
/// sees that period's payments plus its non-anchor incomes.
///
/// Two consequences worth stating, because both are easy to get wrong:
///
/// - **A non-anchor income joins on its own date, not before.** The walk
///   reaches it when it reaches its day, exactly as the cutoff rule requires
///   (spec 4.9, rule 3). Nothing is spendable in advance of arriving.
/// - **`is_paid` changes no figure here.** It records what happened; the
///   forecast is about dates. Gating the arithmetic on it would mean future
///   income never counted at all, since nothing can be marked received before
///   it arrives.

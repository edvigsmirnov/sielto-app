Sielto $VERSION+$BUILD (linux-x64)

Run ./sielto from this directory. Nothing needs installing.

Requires GTK 3 and libsecret at runtime; both ship with any current desktop
Linux. Debian/Ubuntu: libgtk-3-0 (or libgtk-3-0t64) and libsecret-1-0.
Fedora: gtk3 and libsecret. libsecret holds the database key in the desktop
keyring, so the app cannot start without it.

To add a menu entry, copy $APP_ID.desktop into
~/.local/share/applications/ and set Exec= to the absolute path of ./sielto,
then copy $BIN.png into ~/.local/share/icons/.
